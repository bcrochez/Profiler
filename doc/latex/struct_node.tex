\subsection{Detailed Description}
Structure representing a \hyperlink{struct_node}{Node} and a Tree. 

The \hyperlink{struct_node}{Node} structure represents a function in a \char`\"{}\-Left son / Right brother\char`\"{} Tree structure Each node possesses a son and a brother (son\-L \& bro\-R) Initially, the values of son\-L and bro\-R are set to N\-U\-L\-L The structure also keeps the start, end and call time of each function 

The documentation for this struct was generated from the following file\-:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
